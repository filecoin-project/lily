-- gap_find
-- Parameters:
--   @min_height  - the lower bound of range of heights to find gaps
--   @max_height  - the upper bound of range of heights to find gaps
--   @null_status - set by the consensus task to indicate a null round
--   @ok_status   - if the task has this status, it is considered complete
-- Returns:    A table of heights and tasks that are missing in the given
